# Running the Array Operations Example

This guide explains how to run the `array_operations.cpp` program.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

## Steps to Run

1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory containing `array_operations.cpp`
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ array_operations.cpp -o array_operations
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   - On Unix/Linux/MacOS:
     ```bash
     ./array_operations
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     array_operations.exe
     ```

## Expected Output

The program will demonstrate:
- Basic array operations (add, remove, access elements)
- Array manipulation (insert, delete, reverse)
- 2D array operations (matrix operations)

Each section will be clearly labeled in the output with "===" separators.
